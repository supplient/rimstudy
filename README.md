# rimstudy
A mod for Rimworld which allows pawns study from books and others.

This is a mod for rimworld, and still under developing. It may be 2020 for the mod to be completed :3, since this is just a toy for me.

Well, my english is very poor... So most documents in this repo are written in Chinese. However, all the code will be written in English because I don't like switch input method frequently when coding. And I can write some simple English and read many complex English like research papers. So if you want to collaborte with me, regardless you are a Chinese, a Japanese or a English speaker, You are welcomed! Just contact to me!
